         <p>Hi! My name is Matt Vartanian, I am a first year at The University of Rhode Island. 
             <br> I am an undecided student with an intrest in computers. I have taken computer 
             <br> classes before however for mostly hardware, in this Computer Science class I
             <br> hope to extend my knowledge of computers. My main intrests outside of school 
             <br> are volleyball and hanging out with my friends. During the summer almost 
             <br> everyday we would go fishing at a pond near our house's. </p>
